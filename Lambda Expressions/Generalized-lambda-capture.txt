### Generalized Capture (C++14)

1. This feature allows creation of new variables in the capture clause.
2. The type of these variables is deduced from the type produced by the expression.
3. Consequently, these variables must always be initialized.
4. If the initializer expression is a variable, the new variable can have the same or different name.
5. To create a reference, you have to use operator & before the variable name

Syntax:-
    [var = expression](args)
    [&var = expression](args)
