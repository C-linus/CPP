### Function Object

1. Object with overloaded function call operator.
2. Call to overloaded function call operator resembles a global function call
3. Can be used as a callback instead of function pointers
4. More efficient than function pointers.
5. Usually implemented as structs.

### Function Pointer Vs Function Object

## Function Pointer

1. Invoked through a Pointer
2. Dynamic in nature
3. Can be specified at runtime
4. Difficult to optimize
5. Slow


## Function Object

1. Invoked through an Object
2. Static in nature
3. Must be specified at compile time
4. Easy to optimize
5. Fast



# It is not possible to specify object at runtime
