### Unions in C++

1. Gives the ability to represent all the members in the same memory
2. Saves space
3. However, it has several disadvantages
    1) No way to know which type it holds
    2) Nested types with non-default constructors deletes the  default constructor of the union.
    3) Cannot assign objects of user-defined types directly to a union member
    4) User-defined types are not destroyed implicitly.
    5) Cannot have a base class
    6) Cannot derive from a  union
    7) Union cannot contain virtual functions
