### Const Member Functions

1) Member functions qualified with const keyword
2) Both declaration and definition is qualified
3) such functions cannot change value of any member variables
4) Useful for creating read-only functions
5) Constant objects can invoke only constant member functions

Note:
1) const qualifier applied to the 'this' pointer under the hood, this doesn't allow the function to modify the member variables(attributes).
2) The function qualified with 'this' keyword can only invoke, const member functions, because that const this pointer has to be used to invoke other functions.
