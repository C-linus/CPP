### Object Slicing

1. A situation in which the compiler deliberately removes some part of an object.

2. Occurs when child class object is assigned to a concrete base class object.

3. The size of a child class object may be more than its base.

4. While assigning it to a base object, some part of the memory may get overwritten.

5. This will lead to memory corruption

6. To prevent this, the compiler slices the child object, effectively removing the memory that contains its attributes.

7. The object is then copied into the base object.
