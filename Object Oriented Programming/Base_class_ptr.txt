### How does a base class pointer can point to derived class objects?


## 🧩 1. Think of a derived object as **“base + extra data”**

When you define:

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    int a;
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    int b;
};
```

In memory, a `Derived` object looks like this:

```
+----------------+
| Base::a        |   <-- base subobject
+----------------+
| Derived::b     |   <-- derived part
+----------------+
```

So you can imagine `Derived` as a **Base object at the start** of a larger block.
That’s what allows **a pointer to Base** to also point to the *Base portion* inside any Derived object.

---

## 🧠 2. Pointer adjustment happens automatically

When you write:

```cpp
Derived d;
Base* bp = &d;
```

C++ automatically **adjusts** the pointer to point to the Base portion inside `d`.

* Here, `&d` is the address of the entire `Derived` object.
* But when assigned to a `Base*`, the compiler adjusts it to the **address of the Base subobject** inside that Derived object.

Because in this simple case (single inheritance), the `Base` subobject is *at the beginning* of `Derived`, both addresses are the same.

Let’s prove that:

```cpp
std::cout << &d << "\n";   // address of full derived object
std::cout << bp << "\n";   // address stored in base pointer
```

Output:

```
0x7ffeefbff590
0x7ffeefbff590
```

Both are identical here — but not always (more on that below).

---

## ⚙️ 3. Why this is safe — type layout guarantees

C++ guarantees that for **public inheritance**, the layout of the base subobject in memory is *preserved* exactly as if it were a standalone `Base`.

So if you take a pointer to that subobject (`Base*`), you can safely access its members using normal operations — because their offsets relative to that pointer are identical.

For instance:

```cpp
bp->a == d.a;  // always true
```

The compiler knows exactly how to access `Base::a` from that pointer, because it starts right at the beginning of the base subobject.

---

## ⚠️ 4. Where pointer arithmetic fails

You’re also right that **pointer arithmetic** doesn’t make sense here.

Example:

```cpp
Base* bp = &d;
bp++; // ❌
```

This doesn’t “skip to the next Derived”.
Pointer arithmetic is based on the **static type** — `sizeof(Base)` — not `sizeof(Derived)`.

So when you increment a `Base*`, the compiler assumes it’s pointing to an array of `Base`, not part of a `Derived`.

That’s why **you should never do pointer arithmetic** on base pointers pointing to derived objects — it violates memory layout assumptions.

---

## 🧠 5. What happens in multiple inheritance

Now things get interesting.
Suppose:

```cpp
class Base1 { public: int a; };
class Base2 { public: int b; };
class Derived : public Base1, public Base2 {
public:
    int c;
};
```

Memory layout:

```
+----------------+
| Base1::a       |  <-- Base1 subobject
+----------------+
| Base2::b       |  <-- Base2 subobject
+----------------+
| Derived::c     |
+----------------+
```

Now:

```cpp
Derived d;
Base2* bp2 = &d;
```

Here, `bp2` does **not** equal `&d` — because the `Base2` subobject starts *after* the `Base1` part.

Compiler automatically adds an **offset** to make the pointer point to the `Base2` region.

That’s why, when you later cast back:

```cpp
Derived* dp = (Derived*)bp2;
```

the compiler subtracts the same offset back (if done via a safe `dynamic_cast` or `static_cast`).

So the pointer adjustment logic ensures correctness, not arithmetic you write.

---

## ⚙️ 6. Dynamic binding (when virtual functions exist)

When you add virtual functions, the base pointer gains a **vtable pointer (vptr)**, and the compiler ensures that calling through the base pointer still dispatches to the derived version correctly.

Example:

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() { std::cout << "Base\n"; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override { std::cout << "Derived\n"; }
};
```

Now:

```cpp
Base* b = new Derived;
b->show();  // prints "Derived"
```

This works because `Base`’s vptr (inside the Base part of the Derived object) points to Derived’s vtable — ensuring correct runtime polymorphism.

Still, the pointer `b` points to the **Base portion** of the Derived object.

---

## 🧩 7. Analogy

Think of a `Derived` object as a big box that starts with a smaller box (`Base`) embedded at its beginning.
A base pointer just points to that inner box — it doesn’t know (or care) about the extra contents behind it.

```
[Base part][Derived-only part]
^
|
Base*
```

The compiler ensures that all operations on that pointer only touch the `Base` portion.

### 🧠 TL;DR

> A base class pointer can point to a derived object because every derived object **contains a complete base subobject** at a known location in memory.
> The compiler automatically adjusts the pointer to that subobject — no “magic arithmetic” happens at runtime; it’s all known at compile time.
