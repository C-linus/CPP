### File I/O

1. C++ provides support for file I/O through following classes
    1.ofstream - write to an output stream
    2.ifstream - read from an input stream
    3.fstream - write/read stream

2.Include <fstream> header
3.All classes can be used for both text & binary I/O
4.Additionally, they support modes that decide how the file is opened and operated.
5.is_open() function returns a boolean indicating if a stream is open.


### File Open modes

1. The following modes canbe used while opening a file
2. These are constants defined in std::ios_base class
3. Some modes can be combined e.g. std::ios::in | std::ios::out, etc

s.no    Mode    Meaning
1.      app     seek to the end before each write operation
2.      binary  open in binary mode
3.      in      open for reading (default for ifstream)
4.      out     open for writing (default for ofstream)
5.      trunc   discard file contents before opening
6.      ate     seek to end after open


### Stream State Flags

s.no    Flag            Meaning                             Function
1.      goodbit         no error                            bool good()
2.      badbit          irrecoverable stream error          bool bad()
3.      failbit         I/O operation failed                bool fail() [operator !]
4.      eofbit          end of file reached during input    bool eof()
