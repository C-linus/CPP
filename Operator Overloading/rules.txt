### Rules

1. Associativity, precedence & arity (operand count) does not change
2. Operator functions should be non-static (Except for new & delete)
3. One argument should be user defined type
4. Global overload if first operand is primitive type
5. Not all Operators can be overloaded (.,?,.*,sizeof)
6. Cannot define new operators
7. Overloaded for conventional behaviour only
