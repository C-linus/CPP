### Type Conversions

1. Conversion between types
2. Performed through casts
3. Ordered by compiler (impicit) or user(explicit)
4. Eplicit conversion uses casting operators
5. Conversion between
    1. Basic & Basic
    2. Basic & user-defined
    3. user-defined & Basic
    4. user-defined & user-defined

### Type Conversion Operator
 
    Used to convert user-defined object to primitive type and used to convert primitive type to primitive type.
    It only works, if the operand on the left matches the type of the operator function.


    syntax:-
        operator <type>() (No arguments & No return type)

    Example:-
        operator int()
