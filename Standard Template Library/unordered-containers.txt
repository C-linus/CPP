### Unordered Containers

1. Associative containers implemented as hash tables
2. Values are hased and stored in undefined order
3. Fast search, insertion/deletion, but may degrade over a period of time
4. std::unordered_set stores values that act as keys for hashing
5. std::unordered_map stores pairs (first is used to compute hash)
6. Iterators are constant
